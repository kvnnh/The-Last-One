#### Game Description ðŸŽ®
The Last One is a typing game where players type the enemy's name to defeat them. The story revolves around the Demon King, whose entire species was wiped out by humans, leaving him as the sole survivor. In revenge, he massacres all humans, until The Demon King becomes the last one remaining in the world.

#### How to Play ðŸŽ®
All you need to do is type the name of the enemy approaching you, or you'll be defeated. You only have 4 hearts, so be careful. You also have a special skill to defeat all enemies by typing "abyss" but it has 30 seconds cooldown.
